winpty
======

winpty is a Windows software package providing an interface similar to a Unix
pty-master for communicating with Windows console programs.  The package
consists of a library (libwinpty) and a tool for Cygwin and MSYS for running
Windows console programs in a Cygwin/MSYS pty.

The software works by starting the ``winpty-agent.exe`` process with a new,
hidden console window, which bridges between the console API and terminal
input/output escape codes.  It polls the hidden console's screen buffer for
changes and generates a corresponding stream of output.

The Unix adapter allows running Windows console programs (e.g. CMD, PowerShell,
IronPython, etc.) under ``mintty`` or Cygwin's ``sshd`` with
properly-functioning input (e.g. arrow and function keys) and output (e.g. line
buffering).  The library could be also useful for writing a non-Cygwin SSH
server.

Prerequisites
=============

You need the following to build winpty:

* A Cygwin or MSYS installation
* GNU make
* A MinGW 32-bit g++ toolchain, v4 or later, to build ``winpty.dll`` and
  ``winpty-agent.exe``
* A g++ toolchain targeting Cygwin or MSYS, v3 or later, to build
  ``console.exe``

Winpty requires two g++ toolchains as it is split into two parts. The
binaries winpty.dll and winpty-agent.exe interface with the native Windows
command prompt window so they are compiled with the native MinGW toolchain.
The console.exe binary interfaces with the MSYS/Cygwin terminal so it is
compiled with the MSYS/Cygwin toolchain.

MinGW appears to be split into two distributions -- MinGW (creates 32-bit
binaries) and MinGW-w64 (creates both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries).  Either
one is acceptable, but the compiler must be v4 or later and produce 32-bit
binaries.

Cygwin packages
---------------

The default g++ compiler for Cygwin targets Cygwin itself, but Cygwin also
packages MinGW compilers from both the MinGW and MinGW-w64 projects.  As of
this writing, the necessary packages are:

* Either ``mingw-gcc-g++`` or ``mingw64-i686-gcc-g++`` (but not
  ``mingw64-x86_64-gcc-g++``)
* ``gcc4-g++``

MinGW packages
--------------

The default g++ compiler for MinGW targets native Windows, but the MinGW 
project also packages compilers to target the MSYS environment itself. The
required packages are:

* ``mingw32-make`` 
* ``g++`` 
* ``msys-dvlpr``


Build
=====

In the project directory, run ``./configure``, then ``make``.

This will produce three binaries:

* ``build/winpty.dll``
* ``build/winpty-agent.exe``
* ``build/console.exe``

Using the Unix adapter
======================

To run a Windows console program in ``mintty`` or Cygwin ``sshd``, prepend 
``console.exe`` to the command-line::

    $ build/console.exe c:/Python27/python.exe
    Python 2.7.2 (default, Jun 12 2011, 15:08:59) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 10 + 20
    30
    >>> exit()
    $
